# HortaTech Challenge

To-do Intro 

## Instructions

To-do 

#### Code object sample

```
{
  type: 'timetracking',
  latitude: '58.4343',
  longitude: '-120.9245',
  created_at: 'Thu, 29 Nov 2018 09:16:09 UTC +00:00'
  // xxx: 'any other field you think you should add'
}
```

## User Stories

As a product-oriented company, the most important part of our job is to understand and build features based on our users' needs. These are the main stories for this challenge:

* As a company manager, I want to have online access to the time at which my employee checked in or out of the company so that I can later calculate and pay or discount worked hours.
* As a company manager, I want to see where my employee was when the timetracking was recorded so that I can tell if the employee was at the correct workplace.
* As a company manager, I want to set specific timetracking geofences so that I can limit timetrackings being recorded only within certain boundaries.
* As an employee, I want to be able to record my timetrackings so that I can report my work to the company manager and later get paid the correct due amount.

## The Challenge

You should create a timetracking solution that serves all user stories described above.
In this challenge you should use (at least) the following technologies:
* Ruby on Rails
* Relational Database
* Javascript
* CSS3 or SCSS
* HTML5

## The Solution

* Create a repository with your solution on Github
* The solution should be ready to run
* Instructions to build the code (database migrations etc) should be clear
* Write all instructions and explain the reasoning behind your technical choices in the README file
### Mandatory Items
* Views
  * Timetracking
    * New/Create timetracking - should contain at least a clock that updates every second, a comment field and a button
    * Show timetracking - shows database information on a particular timetracking
    * Index timetrackings - table with timetrackings, 1 line per item
  * Geofence
    * New/Create - should contain at least latitude, longitude and radius
    * Show - shows database information on a particular geofence
    * Index - table with geofences, 1 line per item
* Timetrackings and Geofences should be stored in the database

* **Disable timetracking button if the user is not inside any of the geofences**

* At least one front-end and one back-end validation
* Timetrackings should be stored with geolocalization information - latitude and longitude are enough and don't need to be precise, but you are expected to implement browser HTML5 geolocalization
* Unit tests. RSpec is recommended. If you are writing tests, make sure they test something meaningful. All written tests should be working and pass when ran.
### Optional Items
These are optional items that could show extra dedication or a particular skill.
* Show timetracking containing the geolocation on a map (you can use google maps api for this)
* Create timetracking - Geolocalization could be created by clicking the location on the map
* Use the SLIM scripting language for views
* Integration and E2E tests (capybara)
* [extra points] At least one component in React
## Expectations
### What we expect
* Use clean code (principles such as DRY, manageable and maintanable)
* Organized and well indented code. Indent with 2 spaces
* It is highly recommended that all names in your code are written in English rather than Portuguese. The UI should be either in Portuguese or English
### What we DON'T expect
* Don't worry about timezone management
* Don't implement authorization or authentication
* Don't waste a huge amount of time on this challenge
* Don't worry about browser compatibility. Assume a modern browser is being used
* Don't worry about creating the most beautiful design or user experience. Views should be DECENT. Feel free to use bootstrap or any other UI framework
* Don't worry about 100% coverage. We just want to see how you think about testing
## Other Information
* Feel free to use any public gems
